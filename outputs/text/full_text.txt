Abstract
In this work, twenty-one core samples of tailings wastes were collected from Yeshan iron tailings
pond in Jiangsu Province, China. The mineralogical-chemical properties of Yeshan iron ore tailings
(IOTs) were investigated to explore potential utilization. Mineralogical investigations and mineral
liberation analysis indicated that the iron tailings have complex texture and incomplete mineral
liberation, suggesting further grinding can improve higher recovery. Yeshan IOTs accumulated much
higher MgO originating from dolomite, therefore, it could be infeasible to utilize a large quantity of
Yeshan IOTs as alternative raw meals for cement clinker or replace aggregates in concrete. 2D
vertical distribution profiles created with the ordinary Kriging method presented heterogeneous
distributions of major elements, and the variation trends were inconsistent. The results obtained in
this work provide insight for exploiting and reducing Yeshan IOTs.

1. Introduction
The mining industry is a cornerstone of modern society. However, large amounts of mine tailings
are deposited on the land surface, cover a vast area, bring environmental pollution problems1-3. In
addition, the management of IOTs pond demands for extra time, human resources and money4. More
seriously, the IOTs dam is a potential safety hazard, threatening people’s safety, lives, and property.
For instance, in 2019, an IOTs dam collapsed in Brazil caused 235 people death and 35 people
missing5. The management of IOT is still one of the major social issues worldwide. In China, the
reserves of IOTs have reached approximately 5 billion tons, whereas less than 20% of them has been
reused6, 7. The "Plan for Preventing and Resolving Safety Risks in Tailings Ponds" jointly issued by
eight ministries and commissions in 2020 stipulates that the number of tailings ponds in China will
no longer increase, and new "overhead ponds" are strictly forbidden. Iron tailings have gradually
become a key factor restricting the sustainable development of mining firms. Therefore, it is urgent
to realize great utilization of iron tailings and achieve the purpose of reduction, harmless disposal
and recycling treatment.
The application of mineralogical and geochemical characterization to mine waste can contribute to
improve risk assessment, guide appropriate mine planning for active mines and optimize remediation
design at abandoned mines8, 9. Accordingly, prior to choosing a tailing disposal and management
strategy and optimizing an environmental remediation design, it is vital to understand the
geochemical and mineralogical properties of tailings10-14. With these essential and previously
research, experiments on utilizing tailings wastes are performed more efficiently and intentionally.
These successful studies can be categorized into developing alternative materials for building
materials15, 16 and ceramics17, 18, and biological reclamation19, 20.
In recent years, minimizing the volume of tailings generated in the original place and maximizing
opportunities for alternative uses of tailings have been highly appreciated21, 22. It requires us to have
better understanding of geochemical and mineralogical properties of tailings. In this work, we
applied an in-situ sampling approach, coupling mineralogical techniques, major element analysis,
and visual technology. The properties of iron ore tailings from Yeshan iron deposit were investigated
from the perspective of mineralogy and geochemistry to explore the potential utilization, which is
beneficial for management to develop robust strategies.

2. Materials and Methods
2. 1 Geology and study area
As shown in Fig. 1, the Yeshan iron tailings pond is located 40 kilometers north of the Nanjing
region of Jiangsu Province, China. The Nanjing region has a subtropical monsoon climate with four
distinct seasons. The average temperatures in January and July were 2.2 °C and 28.6 °C,
respectively23. The tailings wastes are deposited in a small valley, and the height of the tailings pond
is from 78 m to 119 m above sea level. Yeshan iron ore is a hydrothermal metasomatic skarn deposit,
thus, the composition of the original iron ore is very complicated. The principal metallic minerals are
magnetite and hematite, followed by limonite, pyrite and chalcopyrite. Gangue minerals are mainly
serpentine, dolomite and quartz, and small amounts of mica, kaolin, chlorite, etc. The tailings pond
deposits more than 6 million cubic meters of iron tailings wastes.

2.2. Sampling strategy
Core samples of tailings wastes were collected in-situ from three boreholes. As shown in Fig. 1,
the sampling sites, P1, P2, and P3, were on a straight line and arranged along northwest to southeast
transects. Elevation differences among the sampling sites were less than 0.6 m. With a drilling
machine, core samples from each borehole were collected per 4 meters until the crushed rock layer.
The detailed sampling information is listed in Table 1. The samples were collected to meet the
following requirements of the study: (i) to cover the surface and bottom of the waste deposit; (ii) to
collect sufficient samples for a statistical analysis of data. Altogether, twenty-one tailings samples,
approximately 3.0 kg in weight, were obtained and transferred to the laboratory. All collected tailings
samples were air-dried after homogenization. Lumps were broken apart and passed through a 2 mm
sieve to eliminate gravels and roots of plants. Finally, each sample was sealed in a hermetic plastic
bag with an identified number. Aliquots (ca. 300 g) of subsamples taken from each sample
constituted the mixed sample.

2.4 Mineralogical analysis
Subsamples and the mixed sample were analyzed by X-ray diffraction using a Bruker AXS
D8-Focus diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). X-ray diffraction data were collected
between 5° and 60° with a step size of 0.02°. The crystalline phases were identified by matching
peak positions of the intense peaks with those on PCPDF standard cards.
Based on scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), the
advanced mineral liberation analysis (MLA) system can provide detailed information about a wide
variety of mineralogical characteristics, for instance, mineral identification, grain size distribution,
mineral texture and association, and degree of mineral liberation 24. Therefore, the MLA technique is
increasingly applied to analyses of tailings wastes mineralogical properties. MLA was performed
5 / 15
with SEM (Quanta 650, FEI, Netherlands), EDS (Quantax 200, Bruker, Germany) and mineral
parameter automatic analysis software version 2.0.
2.5 Geochemical analysis
Quantitative analysis of the major elements was determined by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy
(XRF, Axios, Netherlands). A subset of each sample, with a mass of 10.0 g, was ground to a fraction
less than 74 μm. A total of 8.0 g of each sample with 2.0 g of organic binder was further ground and
homogenized using a mill. The organic binder consisted of 90 wt.% cellulose and 10 wt.% wax. Then,
the mixtures were placed in an aluminum cup and pressed into pellets under a pressure of 15 MPa for
60 seconds. This step ensured sample integrity under vacuum and a consistent surface to receive the
X-rays.
Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Analytik Jena AG, PlasmaQuant MS)
was applied to determine trace elements in the extracts. Briefly, 0.10 g of ground sample was placed
in a clean 50 ml digestion tube and then digested with 8 ml aqua regia, a mixed solution of 96%
HNO3 and 36% HCl with a volume ratio of 1:1. The digestion process was performed at 140-160 ℃
until a white precipitate remained at the bottom of the tube. Then, the digested residuum was
dissolved in 1% HNO3, and transferred to a volumetric flask and diluted to 50 ml. Blank sample
values from mixed acids prepared in the same way were corrected for the measured data.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Mineralogical properties
The grain size distribution of mineralogical phases was evaluated from the scanning BSE images
with the MLA system. As shown in Fig. 2, the proportions of individual minerals, including
magnetite, limonite, siderite, pyrite, and chalcopyrite, were categorized with a distribution histogram
for vol.%. The grain size distributions are similar in magnetite, limonite and siderite, which are
concentrated in the < 20 μm population. Pyrite and chalcopyrite were the primary sulfide minerals
that occurred with variable size fractions. Both were mainly concentrated in the 80~160 μm range,
accounting for approximately 30 vol.%.

Fig. 3(A) shows a typical X-ray diffraction pattern of the mixed sample. Careful XRD
investigation revealed that Yeshan IOTs consisted chiefly of dolomite, quartz, magnetite, muscovite,
serpentine, and chlorite. The XRD patterns from borehole P1-P3 samples are shown in Fig.3 (B), (C),
and (D), respectively. The diffraction peaks of the patterns were basically consistent, however, the
significantly different intensities of diffraction peaks indicated the various contents of mineral phases
in these samples. This phenomenon occurred not only in different sampling regions, but also at
7 / 15
different depths in the same borehole.

As listed in Table 2, the mineral phases of mixed IOTs identified by the MLA system were
consistent with the XRD results. However, some minor phases (e.g., K-feldspar, diopside, siderite,
pyrite, etc.) were observed in thin sections because of the higher precision compared with XRD.
After iron ore extraction, the magnetite content was still 9.6±0.9 wt.%, while other iron-bearing
minerals, such as pyrite, siderite and limonite, were also detected. The gangue minerals were
dominated by dolomite and serpentine, which accounted for 22.8±1.1 and 16.9±1.0 wt.%, followed
by quartz, K-feldspar and chlorite with contents of 8.7±0.9, 6.8±0.7, and 6.2±0.6 wt.%,
respectively. The proportions of muscovite, diopside, calcite, and talc ranged from 3.2 to 5.7 wt.%.
3.2 Mineral morphologies
The MLA system can provide valuable information on textural features of mineral assemblages on
the micrometer scale. According to the gray values of BSE images, the intelligent software can
identify individual phases based on an adequate mineral standard database25. The BSE images with
the automatic diagnoses of minerals given by the MLA system are shown in Fig. 4.
As presented in Fig. 4 (A), magnetite grains generally range from 10 to 200 μm in cross-section,
8 / 15
with a maximum of approximately 500 μm. Fine-grained and subhedral magnetite crystals were
observed as occlusions with transparent minerals. At the same time, Fig. 4 (B) shows that the
sectional coarse-grained magnetite crystals enfolded some gangue minerals. Multimineral
intergrowths of pyrite with limonite, hematite and siderite were also observed. Fig. 4 (C) shows the
complicated intergrowths of pyrite and limonite with crisscrossing grain boundaries. Fig. 4 (D)
shows that irregular siderite aggregations occurred between hematite and pyrite. Fine-grained
hematite possessing magnetite crystal shapes (Fig. 4 (E)), was enfolded by brucite. Chalcopyrite was
observed in association with serpentine (Fig. 4 (F)). The investigation of mineral morphologies
revealed that mineral liberation from tailings wastes was not completed and further grinding iron ore
is necessary for higher recovery. Despite a few intergrowths existing in different minerals, the
textural structures will allow easy liberation of the constituent mineral phases, suggesting the
feasibility of recycling valuable metals from Yeshan IOTs.

3.3. Geochemical characteristics
The major elements were investigated by XRF analysis, and the results are presented in Fig. 5.
The occurrence of major elements from the measurements followed the order SiO2 > TFe2O3 >
MgO > CaO > Al2O3 > SO3>K2O, where TFe2O3 denotes the total amount of iron oxide, including
Fe2O3 and FeO. This order is basically consistent with the mineralogical characteristics, which
indicated that dolomite serpentine, magnetite, and quartz were the principal minerals. As shown in
Fig. 6, four typical types of IOTs in China, are, high-silicon IOTs, high-alumina IOTs, high-calcium
IOTs and high-magnesium IOTs, respectively. The percentage of MgO in Yeshan IOTs is much
higher than that of high-magnesium IOTs, indicating that Yeshan IOTs are classified as
high-magnesium IOTs. Small quantities of K2O, Na2O, P2O5, TiO2 and MnO were detected at levels
less than 1 wt.%. The presence of K and Na cations could be ascribed to chlorite, K-feldspar and
muscovite, while the phosphorus was presumably contributed by apatite. It is suspected that Ti
substitutes for Al in aluminosilicate phases due to their similar atomic radii.

10 / 15
A number of recent studies indicate that IOTs can be utilized as industrial raw materials to
produce green and sustainable industrial products 26-30. However, the extremely high content of MgO
and high content of SO3 in Yeshan IOTs could bring a huge challenge for using Yeshan IOTs as
alternative raw meals to produce cement. It has been confirmed that abundant MgO and SO3 in raw
meals have negative effects on the formation of cement clinker31, 32. Additionally, a large quantity of
dolomite and serpentine, and relatively abundant clay minerals exist in Yeshan IOTs, which has
adverse effects on the performance of concrete if the Yeshan IOTs replace natural fine aggregates in
concrete. Therefore, using Yeshan IOTs sand for full aggregate replacement of natural gravel in
cementitious materials could be impractical.
3.4. Spatial distribution
The changed composition of raw iron ore at different periods and frequent alterations of sand
outlet positions can cause the elements to exhibit uneven spatial distributions. IOTs have been used
as raw materials in construction building materials33, 34, such as cement, concrete, non-burning bricks
and ceramics. Figuring out the spatial distribution of major elements in tailings ponds is beneficial
for more efficient and reasonable management and utilization of tailings. Ordinary Kriging35, 36 was
applied to quantify the spatial variations of elements in the tailings pond. Enrichment locations of the
elements can be determined visually and accurately with the support of a 2D vertical profile, which
can provide essential information for exploiting Yeshan IOTs in the future.
Based on the chemical composition data at each sampling site, the spatial distribution maps are
presented in Fig. 7. Here, the P1 site was defined as the ordinate origin, and the orientation of the
x-axis was from P1 to P3. At the same time, Pearson correlation analysis was applied to preliminarily
determine correlations between the concentrations of major elements. The positive correlation with
highly significant correlations at p<0.01 and p <0.05 between elements indicates a similar original
source

iron tailings pond.
.
The kriging maps clearly display that the major elements were distributed unevenly in the tailings
pond. As shown in Fig. 7, the distributions of Fe2O3 and FeO are exactly the same, concentrating in
the striped zonation at 6-10 m depth under the topsoil. The distribution of SiO2 is consistent with
Al2O3, indicating that a large proportion of them come from the same aluminosilicate minerals. In
Fig. 8, significant positive correlations between Fe2O3 and FeO (r = 0.736, p < 0.01), SiO2 and Al2O3
(r = 0.986, p < 0.01), also suggest the possible same source of these elements. In addition, high
contents of SiO2 and Al2O3 were concentrated in the P1 region, and a low content of them were
dispersed in the bottom layer of the P2 area. The highest concentrations of CaO occurred in the
bottom layer of the P2 region, while, most MgO accumulated in the bottom layer of the P2 and P3
regions, and the accumulation region of MgO was obviously larger than that of CaO. MgO exhibited
12 / 15
significantly negative correlation with Fe2O3 (r = -0.767, p < 0.01), FeO (r = -0.652, p < 0.01), SiO2
and Al2O3 (both r = -0.548, p < 0.05). Although part of CaO and MgO comes from the dolomite, the
CaO distribution was slightly different from that of MgO. The heat map clearly showed that both
MgO and CaO had highly negative correlations with Fe2O3 (r = -0.767, p < 0.01; r = -0.570, p <
0.01), however, MgO was weakly correlated with CaO.

(n=21). The data is the r values. Blue, white, and red colors denote strong negative correlation, weak
correlation, and strong positive correlation, respectively. “**” and “*” indicate significant
correlations at p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively.
4. Conclusion
The mineralogy and geochemistry of iron ore tailings from Yeshan iron deposit were investigated
with an in-situ sampling approach, coupling mineralogical techniques, major element analysis, and
visual technology. XRD and MLA analyses demonstrated that Yeshan IOTs primarily consisted of
dolomite, serpentine, magnetite and quartz. The BSE images revealed the complex texture of IOTs
and incomplete mineral liberation, indicating further grinding of iron ore is necessary for higher
recovery and feasibility of recycling valuable metals from the IOTs. Owing to a great deal of
dolomite, serpentine and clay, it could be impractical to replace natural gravel with Yeshan IOTs in
concrete.
The major elements present in tailings wastes analyzed by XRF were SiO2, Fe2O3, MgO and CaO.
Due to high level of MgO, Yeshan IOTs were classified as high-magnesium IOTs. The abundant
13 / 15
MgO and SO3 could cause great difficulty in applying Yeshan IOTs as raw cement meals. According
to the 2D vertical distribution profiles created with the ordinary Kriging method, it is found that most
of elements accumulated in certain strata and the variation trends were inconsistent. Fe2O3 and FeO,
SiO2 and Al2O3, showed significant positive correlations, while MgO exhibited a weak correlation
with CaO. The 2D vertical element distribution profiles can provide visual information about the
elements for exploiting Yeshan IOTs.
